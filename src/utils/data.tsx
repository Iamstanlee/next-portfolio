    bio: `I like to call myself a Product Engineer :), 
    This is because of how I put my very core values(quality and attention to details) into building products, I'm currently a Mobile Engineer 
    at <a  href='https://ourpass.co'>Pass</a> 
    working on financial tools to revolutionize digital commerce in Africa.
    <br/>
    I'm a builder at heart, I co-founded and lead product for 
    <a  href='https://kivifood.app'>kivifood</a>,
    an on-demand food delivery startup. I write clean, maintainable and scalable code 
    because i believe in the quest to solve problems for the next billion users,
    I shouldnâ€™t create one for developers like myself. 
    I occasionally mentor at <a href='https://andela.com/learning-community/'>
    Andela learning community</a>
    and do open-source at <a href='https://github.com/iamstanlee'>Github</a>.`,
